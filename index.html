            <p class="text">The price is fair when purchasing from battle beaver. The prices can vary on depending what you are looking for or wanting out of the controller.
                The controllers I purchase are ranging from 130-150 which is cheap when you look at scufs controller modifications. When purchasing from battle beaver
                the people making the controller put it through all types of tests to make sure it it functioning to there standards and there are no bugs.

            <h3 class="header">Durability</h3>
            <p class="text">
                The durability can vary depending on how you are using it and how long you are using it just like any controller.
                The main durability I am going to talk about are the back buttons on the controller. 
                The buttons last a very long time, I play call of duty so I am always smashing my buttons on the back, and 
                the buttons still work after a year. 
                You can also change the buttons if they do become unusable to press which is amazing.

                Battle beaver has alot to offer when wanting a type of controller and what you want to modify on a controller. They offer all of the xbox and ps controllers.
                They even have the pc controllers, game cube, and switch pros for nintendo switch. The only modifier I will talk about are the buttons on the back of the 
                controllers. The buttons allow you to keep your thumbs on the joysticks while also allowing you to press addition buttons to have your movement and gameplay 
                as efficient as possible.

        <div id="Experience" class="tabcontent">

                Getting a battle beaver is worth it. I use to play with different button settings given in game and it was fine, but I started to get cramps and soreness
                in my hands from holding it very weird. After getting the battle beaver my hands have been feeling alot better than before. Being able to improve my movement
                and my aim on a game I love to compete in is a game changer. I would high recommand the modified controller to anybody that loves to compete in a video game
                they love to grind and get better at.
