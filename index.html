                    BattleBeaverCustoms pricing on the controllers are fair price. It depends on if you want to either buy a default made one or modify your very own.
                    The ones I get are usually between 130 and 150, but that is because I play games very competitely and play in call of duty and halo tournaments that
                    are being run online so I like to add in a few modifications to the controller to get advantage when playing. They can get very pricey if you really want a very cool designed controller with modifications.

                    Durability of controllers in general are all based on how often you use them, and what you are using them for. With battle beaver controllers, the controller
                    have a longer span than the ones you buy at gamestop or walmart. The buttons you want to add on the back are very responsive and do not break very easily.
                    I am always smashing the buttons on the back and it always has the same clicking sound and I have yet to have an issue with the responsivness.
