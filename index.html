                    BattleBeaverCustoms pricing on the controllers are fair price. It depends on if you want to either buy a default made one or modify your very own.
                    The ones I get are usually between 130 and 150, but that is because I play games very competitely and play in call of duty and halo tournaments that
                    are being run online. They can get very pricey if you really want a very cool designed controller.
